## Installation

For installation instructions, please refer to the `INSTALLATION.md` file. Click [here](./INSTALLATION.md) to navigate to it.

## Usage

Get started by following these steps to set up both the frontend and backend for SmartForms.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```
   After starting the server, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to create and manage your forms.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add the following keys:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=<YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY>
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/quizApp
   ```
   Replace `<YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY>` with your actual Google API key.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

Both servers need to be running concurrently for the application to function fully.
