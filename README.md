### Teacher Point of View
- **Launching SmartForms:** Teachers begin by opening the Landing page and clicking on "Launch SmartForms."
- **Creating a SmartForm:** With the aid of CopilotKit, teachers create a SmartForm and submit it.
- **Sharing:** A link for the SmartForm is generated and displayed, which the teacher can then share with students for completion.
- **Reviewing Responses:** To review student responses, teachers navigate to `http://localhost:5173/smartforms/responses`. Here, they are required to enter the SmartForm ID and password to access and view the responses.

### Student Point of View
- **Accessing the Form:** Students start by opening the link provided by their teacher.
- **Entering Details:** Students are prompted to input their name and continue to the SmartForm.
- **Completing the SmartForm:** Students answer the questions provided in the SmartForm and submit their responses upon completion.


## Installation

For installation instructions, please refer to the `INSTALLATION.md` file. Click [here](./INSTALLATION.md) to navigate to it.

## Usage

Get started by following these steps to set up both the frontend and backend for SmartForms.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```
   After starting the server, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to create and manage your forms.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add the following keys:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=<YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY>
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/quizApp
   ```
   Replace `<YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY>` with your actual Google API key.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn 
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   yarn run start
   ```

Both servers need to be running concurrently for the application to function fully.
